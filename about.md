I like long walks on the beach and building websites!

I've worked on hundreds of websites for bands, musicians, authors and artists at [HostBaby](http://hostbaby.com) where I work... in tech support. Hope to one day do web development as a full time gig though. 

For now, I play around building personal projects like the site you're on right now. So. Much. Fun. Can't believe people get paid for doing stuff like this.
