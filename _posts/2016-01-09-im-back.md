Hey, guess what? I got a job doing front end web development! "UI Developer" is my official title. Now my days are filled with HTML, CSS and Javascript! Best. Job. Ever!

That was actually a while back, I sort of forgot about making this blog thing happen. That whole "...constant work in progress" thing at the bottom is slightly inaccurate...

Anyway, I'm back!

[Where I left off][day2] was adding images to posts... I didn't quite say *how* to do it though. 

---

huh.. guess I never figured out how to link to posts. [Maybe I should start there!][lmgtfy-post-links]

---

Ah let's see, I learned how to show highlighted code in [the first post][day1], does it work?

{% highlight md %}
![The view out of my window]({{ "{{ site.url " }}}}/img/out-my-window.jpg)
{% endhighlight %}

...sort of... I guess. Oh helps if I specify the right syntax ("markdown"... heh no, actually "mkd".. or "md"?). Erk -- have to do weird escapey stuff to get the jekyll mustache things to show.

Okay. So, looks like we need to do this:

{% highlight md %}
[Name of Link]({{ "{% post_url 2010-07-21-name-of-post " }}%})
{% endhighlight %}

Which doesn't seem to be any easier than a relative url... I don't get it, but let's not kick against the pricks!

HAHAHA the damn thing doesn't even work. 

>Deprecation: A call to ' post_url /sitelog/2015-02-19-day-2 ' did not match a post using the new matching method of checking name (path-date-slug) equality. Please make sure that you change this tag to match the post's name exactly.

Oh okay. wait I see. I'm an idiot. These posts aren't actually in a folder called /sitelog/ jekyll just makes look that way. Let's try this again!

Sweet sweet links. Well, ya know, I think I do want these in a folder called sitelog. 

Wait!

Note to self, please [figure out livereload][live-reload]. This whole F5/Ctrl-R business is for the birds!

Had to figure out how to style those \<hr\>'s 

Pretty cool that Sass is built into jekyll, pretty lame that sourcemaps aren't on by default! Ugh. I guess some sass: settings in _config.yml? I can't figure it out though.

Anyway, I moved the posts to their own folder, guess what? the links to them still work! Okay, good feature.

Except it doesn't build on github? hmmm.
