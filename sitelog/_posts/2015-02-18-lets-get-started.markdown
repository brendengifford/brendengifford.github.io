Here we go!

Well, I'm just trying this out and don't have much to talk about. I've started a site on [GitHub Pages][github-pages] using [Jekyll][jekyll] since I've been hearing about it and it seemed pretty cool. I think my idea is to have a place that I can link to stuff that I've done and also to keep track of stuff that I've used. Maybe start blogging some stuff that I care to write about. I'm not that good of a writer, but maybe I'll get better!

Let's try out this code highlighter thingy

{% highlight css %}
.selector {
  color: #666;
  line-height: 1.5em;
}
{% endhighlight %}

How's that look?

Stoked to try out some more stuff. For now I'm going to post this and see what's up!
