You're being tracked! I added Google Analytics so I can see all the robots from Russia and China that look at my pages.

It was stupid simple to set up. Went to Google Analytics, added [brendengifford.github.io][me], it gave me some JavaScript, pasted it into the source code. I thought I remembered that it was supposed to go at the bottom of the page, just before the </body> tag, I doubled checked with a quick google search and was surprised to find this [StackOverflow][so] answer that says it's recommended to put just before the </head> tag now. Well, well, well, really what's the point of trying to remember how to do anything, look it up anyway because it's probably changed!

That's all I wanted to do for now. 

I'm downloading my old website from 2011 so I can finally cancel my hosting plan. Just found the favicon I made for it: ![The favicon of my old website]({{ site.url }}/img/old-site-favicon.png) I'd like to think I've moved on from poop humor, but I would be wrong -- it still cracks me up.
