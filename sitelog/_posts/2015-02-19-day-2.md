Alright, so my plan now is not to have a blog, but to start posting here to keep track of my progress in building this site. Sort of like a log of what I'm doing. Like a log on the web. A web log. Blog. Shit.

Well, I slapped together a [Contact page][contact] because I wanted to use some HTML to make a page instead of just Markdown. Worked *okay*, but damn I like making my own contact forms. I doubt GitHub allows access to PHP mail or anything, so [Wufoo][wufoo] to the rescue!

Then I wrote this post up. Will I stop there?? Not likely! Well, maybe... I'm kinda hungry... sandwich time!

Went for enchiladas instead. Now I'm back I want to just dive into making something out of this site, but I'm going to start by going through the [Jekyll docs][docs] first. Not a bad idea, eh??

So, let's try this adding an image business.
